Exploring vitamin B1 cycling and its connections to the microbial community in the north Atlantic ocean

Suffridge C.P.1, Bolaños L.M, Bergauer K., Worden A.Z., Morré J., Behrenfeld M.J., and Giovannoni S.J.

Samples used in this study were collected as part of NAAMES, specifically in the stations of the last field campaign (March-April 2018) which targeted the accumulation phase of the north Atlantic phytoplankton spring bloom 

The community composition analysis derives directly from the 16S rRNA NAAMES data presented in NAAMES_2020/Tables and NAAMES_2020/Rscripts presented in the manuscript "Seasonality of the microbial community composition in the western North Atlantic".
